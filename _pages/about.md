![Mission Control](/images/mcc_jsc.jpg){:.align-right width="400px"}
I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Pittsburgh studying Electrical & Computer Engineering.

My research interests are fault-tolerant computing, reliable machine learning, and computer architecture.

# Selected Experience
## NASA
Since 2019, I have had the privilege of interning at a several NASA centers and contributed to a variety of projects.  

2019:         NASA Langley - Safety-Critical Avionic Systems Branch - Research Intern  
Project: [Autonomous Freeflyers for Spacecraft Inspection](#autonomous-freeflyers-for-spacecraft-inspection)  

2020-Present: NASA Johnson Space Center - Human Interface Branch- Graduate Pathways Intern
Projects: [Radiation-Tolerant Display System](#radiation-tolerant-display-system) & [JointAR](#jointar)

### Radiation-Tolerant Display System

![SCC2023 Talk](/images/scc23_talk.jpg){:.align-left width="300px"}
Lead system architect for a radiation-tolerant display system prototype at NASA for future astronaut displays.

Developed a modular and scalable solution for spacesuits, rovers, and spacecraft which balances high-performance computing with radiation-tolerance.  

Constructed and managed a multi-phase development plan starting with a table-top demonstration evolving to engineering and flight models.  

Presented at the 2023 IEEE Space Computing Conference. Cal Tech, Pasadena, CA.

### JointAR
![JointAR HUT](/images/JointAR_hut.jpg){:.align-right width="350px"}

Served as a fault-tolerant computing researcher, avionics lead, and software engineer for the Joint Augumented Reality Visual Informatics System (Joint AR).  

Joint AR explores how a near-eye augmented reality display might be fielded as a centralized information display upon which crew can make mission decisions while performing extravehicular activity (EVA).  

Researched methods for handling soft-errors for graphics-processing applications.  

Implemented an advanced gesture-based control scheme for the next generation spacesuits (xEMU) Heads-In Display leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques in a resource-constrained embedded system.

### Autonomous Freeflyers for Spacecraft Inspection
Designed and developed a multi-agent drone systems that utilized distributed computing and computer vision to simulate autonomous free flier inspection of spacecraft.

## CASPR
![CASPR](/images/caspr.jpg){:.align-right width="250px"}
Configurable and Autonomous Sensor Processing Research (CASPR) was designed to evaluate autonomous, onboard processing strategies on novel sensors and has been operating on the ISS since 2021 as part of the DoD/NASA Space Test Program – Houston 7 (STP-H7) mission.  

I served as a hardware and software team member for CASPR an International Space Station (ISS) research experiment to study and evaluate novel technologies in sensors, computers, and intelligent applications for SmallSat-based sensing with autonomous data processing.  

Lead GPU fault-tolerance sub-experiment.

## Radition Testing
![Los Almaos National Labs](/images/lansce_2019.jpg){:.align-right width="300px"}
Conducted radiation test campaigns to evaluate and characterize complex computing devices (System-on-chip, GPUs, TPUs, etc.) By understanding faults and failure modes of each device under test (DUT), mitigation strategies can be developed to enhance reliability.  

A variety of testing was conducted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Destructive Single-Event Effects (SEEs). Additional testing for non-destructive Single-Event Effects were conducted under neutron radiation at Los Alamos National Labs (LANL).
