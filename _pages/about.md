I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Pittsburgh studying Electrical & Computer Engineering.

My research interests are fault-tolerant computing, reliable machine learning, and computer architecture.


# Selected Experience
## NASA
Since 2019, I have had the privilege of interning at a several NASA centers and contributed to a variety of projects.  

2019:         NASA Langley - Safety-Critical Avionic Systems Branch - Research Intern  
Project: [Autonomous Freeflyers for Spacecraft Inspection](#autonomous-freeflyers-for-spacecraft-inspection)  

2020-Present: NASA Johnson Space Center - Human Interface Branch- Graduate Pathways Intern
Projects: [Radiation-Tolerant Display System](#radiation-tolerant-display-system) & [JointAR](#jointar)

### Radiation-Tolerant Display System
Lead system architect for a radiation-tolerant display system prototype at NASA for future astronaut displays. Developed a modular and scalable solution for spacesuits, rovers, and spacecraft which balances high-performance computing with radiation-tolerance. Constructed and managed a multi-phase development plan starting with a table-top demonstration evolving to engineering and flight models.

## CASPR
![CASPR](/images/caspr.jpg){:.align-right width="200px"}
Configurable and Autonomous Sensor Processing Research (CASPR) was designed to evaluate autonomous, onboard processing strategies on novel sensors and has been operating on the ISS since 2021 as part of the DoD/NASA Space Test Program â€“ Houston 7 (STP-H7) mission.  

I served as a hardware and software team member for CASPR an International Space Station (ISS) research experiment to study and evaluate novel technologies in sensors, computers, and intelligent applications for SmallSat-based sensing with autonomous data processing.  

Lead GPU fault-tolerance sub-experiment.
